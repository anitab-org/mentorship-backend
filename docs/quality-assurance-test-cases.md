This document contains some examples of test cases for each feature implemented on the backend.

**Tools:**
- Create disposable emails to create accounts and verify them. You can use https://temp-mail.org/ to generate the emails and verify them;
- Test the REST API with Swagger UI provided in the link of the deployed server;
- Test the REST API using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) (if you feel comfortable with this).

**Notes:**
- Outcome _Fail_ means the test case as no effect in the database, so no changes are done in the data. An error message should be returned;
- Outcome _Success_ means that the test case was successful and had an effect in the database, so this change/effect should be visible on the database. E.g.: If a user is registered successfully, you should be able to login, and be seen using the GET /users API;
- When testing something make sure only one aspect of the test is failing the requirements;
- “Logged in” means that a valid access token is being sent in the Authorization header;
- Nonrestricted API will have a marker -> (not restricted);
- A user can login successfully only if the email is verified.

## Access to restricted APIs

- This is the possible test cases when accessing a restricted API;
- The only unrestricted APIs are: POST /login, POST /register, GET /user/confirm_email/{token}, POST/user/resend_email;
- _Fail_ cases mean that you cannot access the app data and you’ll receive an error message regarding the authentication token;
- __This cases should override any potential success outcome from a restricted API_._
