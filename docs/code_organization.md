**Main Components:**
- **Data Model:** This contains all database models, which are implemented using SQLAlchemy Model abstraction, e.g.: UserModel, MentorshipRelationModel.
- **Data Access Object (DAO):** These classes contain functions used by the API resources and use Database Models.
- **API Resources:** This is responsible for the REST API available form the deployed server. These resources define the namespaces, i.e., resources HTTP methods. It's also responsible for Swagger documentation.
