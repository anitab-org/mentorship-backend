Welcome to Mentorship System Backend Docs!

## About

Mentorship System is an application that matches women in tech to mentor each other, on career development, through 1:1 relations during a certain period of time. This is the backend of this system.

This project was proposed as [an original project of Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/6592097335377920/) 2018 edition, by [Isabel Costa](https://github.com/isabelcosta). Isabel was mentored by [Dilushi](https://github.com/Dilu9218), [Murad](https://github.com/m-murad), [Roopal](https://github.com/roopalJazz) and [May](https://github.com/exactlymay) as a project manager. You can see Isabel's [proposal here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TkyLWbVyW9WHEoqFBwpE1GE6vDRf7aoITT6i7tBFKsw).

You can learn more about the idea through ["Mentorship System by Systers"](https://medium.com/systers-opensource/mentorship-system-by-systers-52dbe1275d9f) blog post.

You can find the Android application that uses this backend here: [anitab-org/mentorship-android](https://github.com/anitab-org/mentorship-android)
