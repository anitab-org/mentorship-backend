The users used here are 

* _testusera_
* _testuserb_
* _testuserc_

<h2>Login as the users and capture the access tokens</h2>

Steps to login and capture the token are shown in 
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRZrdR47R-w&feature=youtu.be&t=672)

<h2>Get the user ID's of the users</h2>

In this example they are:

* _testusera_ - ID: 120
* _testuserb_ - ID: 121
* _testuserc_ - ID: 122

<h2>Create a task under a relation.</h2>

_testusera_ creates a task for the relation 13. This will be successful because _testusera_ is a part of this relation.

_testuserc_ cannot create a task under this relation
