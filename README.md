Mentorship System is an application that allows women in tech to mentor each other, on career development topics, through 1:1 relations for a certain period.
This is the Backend REST API for the Mentorship System.

This API is being used by 3 frontend projects currently being developed:
- android: [anitab-org/mentorship-android](https://github.com/anitab-org/mentorship-android)
- iOS: [anitab-org/mentorship-ios](https://github.com/anitab-org/mentorship-ios)
- flutter: [anitab-org/mentorship-flutter](https://github.com/anitab-org/mentorship-flutter)

## Setup and run

To setup the project locally read these wiki pages and follow the instructions:

 - [Fork, Clone and Remote](https://github.com/anitab-org/mentorship-backend/wiki/Fork%2C-Clone-%26-Remote)
 - [Export Environment Variables](docs/environment-variables.md)

### Run app in Windows

The project runs on Python 3.

1. Create a virtual environment:
```
virtualenv venv --python=python3
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
For Git Bash Users:
```
source ./venv/Scripts/activate
```
For Windows Command Line Users:
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install all the dependencies in `requirements.txt` file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Make sure you create `.env` using `.env.template` and update the values of corresponding environment variables
or make sure you exported the following [environment variables](docs/environment-variables.md):

```
export FLASK_ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG=<local-or-dev-or-test-or-prod-or-stag>
export SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>
export SECURITY_PASSWORD_SALT=<your-security-password-salt>
export MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=<mail-default-sender>
export MAIL_SERVER=<mail-server>
export APP_MAIL_USERNAME=<app-mail-username>
export APP_MAIL_PASSWORD=<app-mail-password>
export MOCK_EMAIL=<True-or-False>
```

If you're testing any environment other than "local", then you have to also set these other variables:
```
export DB_TYPE=<database_type>
export DB_USERNAME=<database_username>
export DB_PASSWORD=<database_password>
export DB_ENDPOINT=<database_endpoint>
export DB_NAME=<database_name>
```

5. Run the app:
```
python run.py
```

6. Navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your browser

7. When you are done using the app, deactivate the virtual environment:
```
deactivate
```

### Run app in Linux

The project runs on Python 3.

1. Create a virtual enviorntment:
```
virtualenv venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install all the dependencies in `requirements.txt` file:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Make sure you create `.env` using `.env.template` and update the values of corresponding environment variables. Make sure you exported the following [environment variables](docs/environment-variables.md) if you didn't adapt `.env.template` in the `.env` file:

```
export FLASK_ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG=<local-or-dev-or-test-or-prod-or-stag>
export SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>
export SECURITY_PASSWORD_SALT=<your-security-password-salt>
export MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=<mail-default-sender>
export MAIL_SERVER=<mail-server>
export APP_MAIL_USERNAME=<app-mail-username>
export APP_MAIL_PASSWORD=<app-mail-password>
export MOCK_EMAIL=<True-or-False>
```

If you're testing any environment other than "local", then you have to also set these other variables in the .env file.
```
export DB_TYPE=<database_type>
export DB_USERNAME=<database_username>
export DB_PASSWORD=<database_password>
export DB_ENDPOINT=<database_endpoint>
export DB_NAME=<database_name>
```

Use: `printenv` to print the environment variables and check all configurations.

5. Run the app with `python run.py` or:
```
 export FLASK_APP=run.py
 flask run
```

6. Navigate to http://localhost:5000 or the current server in which you are running(will be shown when app is running) in your browser.

7. When you are done using the app, deactivate the virtual environment:
```
deactivate
```

or use:

```
source deactivate
```

### Run with docker

1. Make sure you exported the following [environment variables](docs/environment-variables.md) to `.env` file

2. Build docker image
```
docker build -t mentorship-backend:latest .
```
3. Deploy
Docker container ports must be mapped to the host machine port using '--publish' so they're visible.
```sh
docker run --env "FLASK_APP=run.py" --publish 5000:5000 mentorship-backend:latest
```

### Run tests

To run the unitests run the following command in the terminal (while the virtual environment is activated):

```
python -m unittest discover tests
```

### Auto-formatting with black

We use [_Black_](https://github.com/psf/black) to format code automatically so that we don't have to worry about clean and
readable code. To install _Black_:

```
pip install black
```

To run black:

```
black .
```

## Branches

The repository has the following permanent branches:

 * **master** This contains the code which has been released.

 * **develop** This contains the latest code. All the contributing PRs must be sent to this branch. When we want to release the next version of the app, this branch is merged into the `master` branch. This is the branch that is used in the deployed version of the app on Heroku.

 * **bit** This branch is for MS-backend version specific to [BridgeInTech](https://github.com/anitab-org/bridge-in-tech-backend) project. All the contributing PRs related to BIT-MS integration issue must be sent to this branch.<br>
**IMPORTANT!!** If this is your first time setting up the BridgeInTech project, please <b>DO NOT RUN</b> the MS backend server from this branch <b>BEFORE</b> you run the BIT backend server. Failing to do this will mess up the postgres db schemas used in BIT project. More instruction on setting up the BridgeInTech project can be found [here](https://github.com/anitab-org/bridge-in-tech-backend/blob/develop/.github/ENV_SETUP_INSTRUCTION.md).
