[Mentorship System](https://github.com/anitab-org/mentorship-backend) is an application that allows women in tech to mentor each other, on career development topics, through 1:1 relations for a certain period.
This is the Backend REST API for the Mentorship System.

This API is being used by 3 frontend projects currently being developed:
- android: [anitab-org/mentorship-android](https://github.com/anitab-org/mentorship-android)
- iOS: [anitab-org/mentorship-ios](https://github.com/anitab-org/mentorship-ios)
- flutter: [anitab-org/mentorship-flutter](https://github.com/anitab-org/mentorship-flutter)

## Setup and run

To setup the project locally read these wiki pages and follow the instructions:

 - [Fork, Clone and Remote](https://github.com/anitab-org/mentorship-backend/wiki/Fork%2C-Clone-%26-Remote)
 - [Export Environment Variables](docs/environment-variables.md)

### Run app

The project runs on Python 3. We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies.

1. [Install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation):

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:
`poetry install`

3. Activate the virtual environment (auto-crated by Poetry):
`poetry shell`

4. Make sure you create `.env` using `.env.template` and update the values of corresponding environment variables
or make sure you exported the following [environment variables](docs/environment-variables.md):

```
export FLASK_ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG=<local-or-dev-or-test-or-prod-or-stag>
export SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>
export SECURITY_PASSWORD_SALT=<your-security-password-salt>
export MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=<mail-default-sender>
export MAIL_SERVER=<mail-server>
export APP_MAIL_USERNAME=<app-mail-username>
export APP_MAIL_PASSWORD=<app-mail-password>
export MOCK_EMAIL = <True-or-False>
```

If you're testing any environment other than "local", then you have to also set these other variables:
```
export DB_TYPE=<database_type>
export DB_USERNAME=<database_username>
export DB_PASSWORD=<database_password>
export DB_ENDPOINT=<database_endpoint>
export DB_NAME=<database_name>
```

5. Run the app:
```
poetry run start
```

6. Navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your browser

7. When you are done using the app, deactivate the virtual environment:
```
deactivate
```

### Run with docker

1. Make sure you exported the following [environment variables](docs/environment-variables.md) to `.env` file

2. Build docker image
```
docker build -t mentorship-backend:latest .
```
3. Deploy
Docker container ports must be mapped to the host machine port using '--publish' so they're visible.
```sh
docker run --env "FLASK_APP=run.py" --publish 5000:5000 mentorship-backend:latest
```

### Run tests

To run the unitests run the following command in the terminal (while the virtual environment is activated):

```
poetry run test
```
