[Mentorship System](https://github.com/systers/mentorship-backend) is an application that allows women in tech to mentor each other, on career development topics, through 1:1 relations for a certain period.
This is the Backend REST API for the Mentorship System.

## Setup and run

To setup the project locally read these wiki pages and follow the instructions:

 - [Fork, Clone and Remote](https://github.com/systers/mentorship-backend/wiki/Fork%2C-Clone-%26-Remote)
 - [Export Environment Variables](https://github.com/systers/mentorship-backend/wiki/Environment-Variables)

### Run app

The project runs on Python 3.

1. Create a virtual environment:
`virtualenv venv --python=python3`

2. Activate the virtual environment:
`source ./venv/bin/activate`

3. Install all the dependencies in `requirements.txt` file:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Make sure you create `.env` using `.env.template` and update the values of corresponding environment variables
or
make sure you exported the following [environment variables](https://github.com/systers/mentorship-backend/wiki/Environment-Variables):

```
export FLASK_ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG=<local-or-dev-or-test-or-prod-or-stag>
export SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>
export SECURITY_PASSWORD_SALT=<your-security-password-salt>
export MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=<mail-default-sender>
export MAIL_SERVER=<mail-server>
export APP_MAIL_USERNAME=<app-mail-username>
export APP_MAIL_PASSWORD=<app-mail-password>
```

If you're testing any environment other than "local", then you have to also set these other variables:
```
export DB_TYPE=<database_type>
export DB_USERNAME=<database_username>
export DB_PASSWORD=<database_password>
export DB_ENDPOINT=<database_endpoint>
export DB_NAME=<database_name>
```

5. Run the app:
`python run.py`

6. Navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your browser 

7. When you are done using the app, deactivate the virtual environment:
`deactivate`

### Run with docker
1. Make sure you exported the following [environment variables](https://github.com/systers/mentorship-backend/wiki/Environment-Variables) to '.env' file

2. Build docker image
```
docker build -t mentorship-backend:latest .
```
3. Deploy
Docker container ports must be mapped to the host machine port using '--publish' so they're visible.
```sh
docker run --env "FLASK_APP=run.py" --publish 5000:5000 mentorship-backend:latest
```

### Run tests

To run the unitests run the following command in the terminal (while the virtual environment is activated):

`python -m unittest discover tests`
