# Contributing Guidelines

* You can join us on [AnitaB.org Open Source Zulip](https://anitab-org.zulipchat.com/).  Each active repo has its own stream to direct questions to (for example #powerup or #portal).  Mentorship System stream is [#mentorship-system](https://anitab-org.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/222534-mentorship-system).
* Remember that this is an inclusive community, committed to creating a safe, positive environment.  See the full [Code of Conduct](../docs/code_of_conduct.md).
* Follow our [Commit Message Style Guide](https://github.com/anitab-org/mentorship-backend/wiki/Commit-Message-Style-Guide) when you commit your changes.
* Please consider raising an issue before submitting a pull request (PR) to solve a problem that is not present in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/anitab-org/mentorship-backend/issues). This allows maintainers to first validate the issue you are trying to solve and also reference the PR to a specific issue.
* When developing a new feature, include at least one test when applicable.
* When submitting a PR, please follow [this template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) (which will probably be already filled up once you create the PR).
* When submitting a PR with changes to user interface (e.g.: new screen, or an email template), please add screenshots to the PR description.
* When you are finished with your work, please squash your commits otherwise we will squash them on your PR (this can help us maintain a clear commit history). 
* When writing in-code documentation as Docstrings, please follow [this guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings).
* When creating an issue to report a bug in the project, please follow our [bug_report.md](https://github.com/anitab-org/.github/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) template.

## General Guidelines

* If you’re just getting started work on an issue labeled “First Timers Only” in any project. Additional resources are available on our [website](http://www.systers.io).
* In an active repository (not an archived one), choose an open issue from the issue list, claim it in the comments, and a maintainer will assign it to you.  
* After approval you must make continuous notes on your progress in the issue while working.  If there is not at least one comment every 3 days, the maintainer can reassign the issue.
* Create a branch specific to the issue you're working on, so that you send a PR from that branch instead of the base branch on your fork.
* If you’d like to create a new issue, please go through our issue list first (open as well as closed) and make sure the issues you are reporting do not replicate the existing issues. 
* Have a short description on what has gone wrong (like a root cause analysis and description of the fix), if that information is not already present in the issue.
* If you have issues on multiple pages, report them separately. Do not combine them into a single issue.
