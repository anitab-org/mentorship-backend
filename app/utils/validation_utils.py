"""This module is to check the validity of input for the "name", "email", "username" fields
against predetermined patterns as well as to ensure the string input is within the accepted length.

For the "name" field to be valid, it may contain one or more character from:
- letter "a" to "z" and/or "A" to "Z", 
- any of the whitespace characters, and/or
- special character "-".

For the "email" field to be valid, it must have the following structure:
> the first section, which may contain one or more character from:
    - letter "a" to "z" and/or "A" to "Z",
    - number "0" to "9",
    - special character "_", ".", "+", and/or "-".
> followed by the "@" character,
> followed by the second section, which may contain one or more character from:
    - letter "a" to "z" and/or "A" to "Z",
    - number "0" to "9", and/or
    - special character "-".
> followed by the escaped character ".",
> followed by the third section, which may contain one or more character from:
    - letter "a" to "z" and/or "A" to "Z",
    - number "0" to "9",
    - special character "-" and/or ".".

For the "username" field to be valid, it may contain one or more character from:
    - letter "a" to "z" and/or "A" to "Z",
    - number "0" to "9", and/or
